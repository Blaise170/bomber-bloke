Bomb bloke works on a timer.

Every game cycle:

  1) Player positions (based on the direction attributes of each player)
  2) Bomb Timers (on 0, explosion is triggered)
  3) Explosion Timers (any existing explosions are added to a Maze
	  size array so that they can be drawn properly
  4) Computer AI, changing the direction attributes of each player
	  and maybe dropping a bomb
  5) Draw Screen
